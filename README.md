This repositorie is when you want to bot using the v14 version of DiscordJS. It's made to allow you to get started simply without messing with the standard stuff. A better result has been achieved by configuring NodeJS with TypeScript for the ultimate performance and experience. To run the code, simply follow the steps below.

# Setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wraith4081/DiscordJS-v14-template.git
cd DiscordJS-v14-template
```
or
```sh
mkdir DiscordJS-v14-template && cd DiscordJS-v14-template
git clone https://github.com/wraith4081/DiscordJS-v14-template.git .
```

# Installation
We need to write this command to use npm packages.
```sh
npm install
```
Sometimes, when using TypeScript, there may be an error, so entering this code after entering the above code can be a solution to your problem.
```sh
npm install typescript @types/node
```

# Running
If you are sure that everything is ready, you can edit the config.ts file according to you. And when you're ready to run, you can run the code below! I wish you good coding!
```sh
npm start
```
